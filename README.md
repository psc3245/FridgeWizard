# Fridge Wizard:
Fridge Wizard is a full stack web application that acts as a kitchen manager that I am currently working on on the side. It is an in progress application that I contribute to in my free time. It's main areas of features are **Food**, **Recipes**, **Grocery Lists**, **Stats**, and **Profile**.

# Food:
Planned Functionality:
### Inventory Management:
Add, Use, and Remove foods. Foods include ingredients and normal food items. A place to add foods, which includes a dropdown menu that autofills, and adds food to DB. 
### Food Display:
Shows all food the user currently has. Displayed in a table and has filters for the user to apply.
### Info About Food:
Click into each food and display more information about it. 
### Mass Addition
Functionality to add a bunch of food at once. Would be simplified food displays in a list, containing name, image, brand (?), amount, and unit.

# Recipes:
Planned Functionality
### Recipe:
Create and display recipes, which consist of instructions, ingredients and amounts. Use inventory to determine if the necessary ingredients are had already or must be bought. Can store recipes to make later.
### Make Recipe:
"Make this" button on recipes. Starts a step by step tutorial, then when it's done, adds recipe to history, adds to statistics, and subtracts quantities from inventory. 

# Grocery Lists:
### Make A List:
Make and store grocery lists. They are composed of foods and amounts, as well as prices. List will calculate (as accurate as possible) price of groceries. Can click into list to edit or mark list as "bought."
### Buy A List:
If a list is "bought," it brings up a Mass Addition and auto populates all food in the grocery list and their respective amounts.

# Stats
### Consumption Stats:
Computes stats for food consumed. Averages, totals, recipes stats, etc.
### Price Stats:
Computes stats for money spent based on grocery lists.

# Profiles
User will have a connected profile. This will be view/manage profile page.
